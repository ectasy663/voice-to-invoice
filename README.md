## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- Modern web browser with microphone support
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ectasy663/voice-to-invoice.git
   cd voice-to-invoice
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **🔒 Set up environment variables (IMPORTANT)**:

   ```bash
   # Copy environment templates
   cp .env.example .env
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

   # Edit the files with your actual credentials
   # See SECURITY_SETUP.md for detailed instructions
   ```

5. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m app.main
   ```

6. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal)

### 🔐 Security Setup

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before running the application, you must configure your environment variables securely.

📖 **Read the complete security guide**: [SECURITY_SETUP.md](./SECURITY_SETUP.md)

Quick checklist:

- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values
- [ ] Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and update values
- [ ] Never commit `.env` files to version control
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords and API keys

### Building for Production

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `frontend/dist` directory.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Authentication

1. Open the application
2. Enter any email address and a password (minimum 6 characters)
3. Use the eye icon to toggle password visibility
4. Click "Sign In" or "Sign Up" - both will work with the mock authentication
5. Toggle between login and signup using the link at the bottom

### Recording Voice

1. After logging in, click the microphone button in the main interface
2. Allow microphone access when prompted by your browser
3. The microphone button will turn red and animate while recording
4. Speak your invoice details clearly
5. Click the microphone button again to stop recording

### Generating Invoice

1. Wait for the voice transcription to complete (simulated 2-second delay)
2. Review the transcribed invoice content in the chat-like display
3. Click "Generate Invoice PDF" to download the invoice file
4. Use the "Clear" button to remove transcription and start over
