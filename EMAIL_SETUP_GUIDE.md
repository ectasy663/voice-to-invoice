# 📧 Email Service Setup Guide

## Current Implementation

Your VoiceInvoice app now supports **real email delivery** for OTP verification! Here's how the email system works and how to configure it for production.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Current Demo Mode**

- **Simulation Enabled**: Set in `.env` file with `VITE_SIMULATE_EMAIL=true`
- **Email Preview**: Opens in new browser tab showing realistic email design
- **Console Logging**: Shows email content in browser console
- **Browser Notifications**: Shows OTP code as notification
- **Fallback Testing**: Use OTP `123456` for testing

### 2. **Real Email Features**

- Beautiful HTML email templates
- Professional email design with branding
- Clear OTP presentation
- Security warnings and instructions
- Responsive email layout

## 🚀 Setting Up Real Email Delivery

### Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended for Frontend)

1. **Create EmailJS Account**

   - Go to [https://www.emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create a new service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

2. **Create Email Template**

   ```html
   Subject: Your VoiceInvoice Verification Code Hello {{to_name}}! Your
   verification code to {{purpose}} {{app_name}} is: {{otp_code}} This code will
   expire in {{expiry_minutes}} minutes. Best regards, The {{app_name}} Team
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```env
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_actual_service_id
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_actual_template_id
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_public_key
   VITE_SIMULATE_EMAIL=false
   ```

### Option 2: Backend Email Service (Production Recommended)

For production apps, it's better to handle email sending on the backend:

1. **Create Backend API Endpoint**

   ```javascript
   // Example Express.js endpoint
   app.post("/api/send-otp", async (req, res) => {
     const { email, otp, purpose } = req.body;

     // Use Nodemailer, SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.
     await sendEmail({
       to: email,
       subject: "Your VoiceInvoice Verification Code",
       html: generateOTPEmailHTML(otp, purpose),
     });

     res.json({ success: true });
   });
   ```

2. **Update Frontend to Use Backend**
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
   VITE_SIMULATE_EMAIL=false
   ```

## 📧 Email Service Providers

### Free Options:

- **EmailJS**: Great for frontend, 200 emails/month free
- **Gmail SMTP**: Free but limited, good for testing
- **Outlook SMTP**: Similar to Gmail

### Paid/Production Options:

- **SendGrid**: 100 emails/day free, then paid plans
- **Mailgun**: 5,000 emails/month free for 3 months
- **Amazon SES**: Very cheap, $0.10 per 1,000 emails
- **Resend**: Modern email API, great developer experience

## 🎨 Email Template Features

The current email system includes:

### Visual Design:

## 🔄 Testing the Email System

### Current Demo:

1. **Sign up or login** with any email
2. **Check browser** for popup window with email preview
3. **Check console** for email content
4. **Look for notification** with OTP code
5. **Use real OTP** from popup or fallback code `123456`

### With Real Email:

1. Set `VITE_SIMULATE_EMAIL=false` in `.env`
2. Configure EmailJS credentials
3. Test with your actual email address
4. Check inbox/spam folder for real email

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Current Security Features:

- ✅ OTP expires after 5 minutes
- ✅ Maximum 3 verification attempts

- ✅ Secure session management

### Production Recommendations:

- 🔒 Use HTTPS for all email API calls

- 🔒 Implement rate limiting for email sending
- 🔒 Use encrypted database for OTP storage
- 🔒 Add audit logging for security events

## 📱 Mobile & Accessibility

The email templates are designed to work well on:

- ✅ Desktop email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird)
- ✅ Web email (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail)
- ✅ Mobile email apps (iOS Mail, Android Gmail)
- ✅ Screen readers and accessibility tools

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Current System**: Use the demo mode to see how emails look
2. **Choose Email Provider**: EmailJS for quick setup, or backend service for production
3. **Configure Credentials**: Update `.env` file with real service credentials
4. **Customize Design**: Modify email templates to match your brand
5. **Add Analytics**: Track email delivery rates and user engagement

## 💡 Tips for Production

- **Monitor Delivery**: Track email delivery success rates
- **Handle Failures**: Implement fallback mechanisms
- **User Feedback**: Show clear messages about email status
- **Performance**: Cache email templates and optimize sending
- **Compliance**: Follow email regulations (CAN-SPAM, GDPR)

Your email system is now ready for both development and production use! 🎉
